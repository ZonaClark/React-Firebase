                constantly challenge themselves to do better. Chovic is a gathering place for people who are 
                unwilling to settle, who pushes hard and persist. Here, you will meet incredible people, find 
                supports, practice stoicism, overcome fear and doubt, have fun, and, most importantly, realize
